# Bo Search

Add search forms to filter customers and orders.

## Installation

### Manually

* Copy the module into ```<thelia_root>/local/modules/``` directory and be sure that the name of the module is BoSearch.
* Activate it in your Thelia administration panel

### Composer

Add it in your main Thelia composer.json file

```
composer require thelia/bo-search-module:~1.0
```

## Usage

Once activated, inputs will appear on the top of the customer and the order list pages. Use them to filter displayed results.

## Hook

Two hooks are added by this module, allowing you to extend forms.

- `bosearch.customer-search.form`: between the last customer's form input and the submit button.
- `bosearch.order-search.form`: between the last order's form input and the submit button.


Then extend the forms in your extension module's EventListener class:

```
TheliaEvents::FORM_AFTER_BUILD . '.' . \BoSearch\Form\OrderSearchForm::ORDER_FORM_NAME => ['yourFunction', 128],
TheliaEvents::FORM_AFTER_BUILD . '.' . \BoSearch\Form\CustomerSearchForm::CUSTOMER_FORM_NAME => ['yourFunction', 128]
```
